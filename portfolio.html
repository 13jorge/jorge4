<h3>The Evolution of Watching Sports, Video Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>For this video I wanted to show the viewer how watching sports has evolved throughout the years and the different types of platforms we can watch sports. I just wanted to show the concept that nowadays you don’t need to go watch sports in person you can see them anywhere you are at now.  </p>

<h3>Control Gamers, Video Installation, 2019</h3>
<p>For this installation we wanted to create a human sculpture but just using gaming products but mainly controllers and mousses since those are the objects that are used the most in gaming. As for the video we recorded different types of platforms where you can play on. Our concept was mainly to show other people who don’t know much about gaming how much gaming can control your life.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Black Square, Net Art, 2019</h3>
<p>I wanted to create a game that was in a way hard but at the same time colorful. I came up with this concept because looking for something is hard especially when it blends in with the background. This a challenging game that but can help with memory coordination. Can you Find the Black Square?</p>
